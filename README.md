java-se-desktop-template
========================
This project is ment to be a start point to create a Java Standard Edition Desktop Application. For practical reasons, I'have tried to cover some of the most popular technologies such as JPA (with Hibernate implementation), Java Jobs (with Quartz) and Swing for GUI.

This is the technologies stack used in this project:

* [Java 7 Swing for User Graphical Interface](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/swing/)
* [Quarts Scheduler 2.2.1 for Chron Jobs](http://quartz-scheduler.org/)
* [Hibernate JPA 4.3.1 for Object Relation Mapping](http://hibernate.org/orm/)
